# MachineLearningAlgorithms

## Decision tree, K-nearest neighbors (KNN), K-means, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Linear/Multiple/Logistic Regression are all popular machine learning algorithms that are commonly referred

Load and preprocess the data: Load the Iris dataset, which typically consists of four features (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width) and one target variable (species class label). Perform any necessary preprocessing steps, such as data normalization or handling missing values.

Split the data: Split the Iris dataset into a training set and a testing/validation set. The training set will be used to train the KNN model, while the testing/validation set will be used to evaluate its performance.

Choose the value of k: Decide on the number of neighbors (k) to consider for classification. This can be done through experimentation and model performance evaluation, e.g., by using cross-validation.

Compute distances: For each data point in the testing/validation set, calculate the distance to all data points in the training set using a distance metric such as Euclidean distance or Manhattan distance. These distances will be used to identify the k-nearest neighbors.

Find k-nearest neighbors: Select the k-nearest neighbors based on the computed distances. These are the training data points that are closest to the testing/validation data point.

Perform classification: For classification tasks, determine the majority class among the k-nearest neighbors and assign it as the predicted class for the testing/validation data point.

Evaluate model performance: Calculate accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, or other relevant performance metrics on the testing/validation set to assess the performance of the KNN model.

Hyperparameter tuning: Repeat steps 3-7 with different values of k to find the optimal value that gives the best performance on the testing/validation set.

Model deployment: Once you have chosen the optimal hyperparameters and evaluated the model performance, you can deploy the trained KNN model to make predictions on new, unseen data.

Model maintenance: Keep monitoring the performance of the deployed KNN model and update it as needed to ensure its accuracy and relevance over time.

Here's a basic outline of the steps to implement the KNN algorithm on the Iris dataset. Keep in mind that you may need to implement additional optimizations or modifications depending on the specific requirements of your project, such as using weighted KNN, handling categorical features, or optimizing the distance calculation for efficiency.
